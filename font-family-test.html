    body   { font-family: "a fake font", Georgia, serif; }
    h1, h2 { font-family: "another fake font", "Gill Sans", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif; }

  <h1>Font-Family computed style test</h1>

  <h2>Test paragraphs</h2>
  <p>This paragraph inherits the font-family declaration from the body tag, which leads with another fake font, with Georgia and serif as fallbacks.</p>
  <p style="font-family: foobar, Verdana, sans-serif">This paragraph has an inline font-family declaration that leads with a fake font, with Verdana and sans-serif as a fall backs.</p>

  <h2>Behavior</h2>
  <p>Using firebug in Firefox to inspect these paragraphs, shows the font-family in the computed style to include the full stack.</p>
  <p>Using the Web Inspector in Safari 4 to inspect these paragraphs, shows the font-family in the computed style to only include the first fontâ€”the fake one..</p>
  <p>Using Dragonfly in Opera 9.62 to inspect these paragraphs, shows the font-family in the computed style to only include all valid(?)/installed fonts.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Three standards-compliant browsers, three completely different behaviors. Impressive.</strong></p>
